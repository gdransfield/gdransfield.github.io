#Instructions

1. Clone or download the repo.

2. Install the requirements:
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run the script entitled 'model_spectra_download.py'.
    $ python model_spectra_download.py
This will download the 10640 model spectra files from Vizie-R directly to the folder called 'model_spectra'.

4. Trust and then start the jupyter notebook CMD_toolkit:
    $ jupyter trust CMD_toolkit.ipynb
    $ jupyter notebook CMD_toolkit.ipynb

5. Click 'Run all' from the 'Cells' drop down menu on the toolbar at the top.

6. Plot a colour-magnitude diagram!



#As this notebook makes use of polynomial coefficients computed by Dupuy & Liu (2012) and model spectra computed by Molli`ere (2015), please cite their papers in addition to ours.
